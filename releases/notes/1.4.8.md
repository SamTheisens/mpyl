#### Discovery

- Add debug logging to build plan discovery methods
- This provides more explanation on _why_ certain projects are selected for each stage
- Can be invoked by setting the `--verbose` for the `build` subcommand, e.g. `mpyl build --verbose status`

#### Bug fixes

- Fixes a bug when a non-changed project is selected whose base path includes fully a changed file's path.
I.e. when the changed file is `projects/project-name/src/main.py` and a project's base path is `projects/project-name-other`,
this other project was wrongly selected as changed.
