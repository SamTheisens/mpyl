#### Hotfix for mapping multiple ports to the same service

Due to a bug in the mapping of multiple ports to the same service, the following configuration:
```yaml
deployment:
  kubernetes:
  portMappings:
    8081: 8081
  traefik:
    hosts:
      ...
      - host:
          all: "Host(`some.other.host.com`)"
        servicePort: 4091
        priority: 1000
```
resulted in `8081` being used as servicePort in the treafik rule instead of `4091`.

#### Release notes

The release notes (as you are reading them now) are generated from the `releases/notes` directory in the project repository.
Whenever a release has changes that require your attention like: new cli commands, new features, breaking changes, upgrade
instructions, etc. they will be included here.
