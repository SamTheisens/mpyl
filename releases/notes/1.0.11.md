#### Hotfix for mapping multiple ports to the same service

Due to a bug in the mapping of multiple ports to the same service, the following configuration:

```yaml
deployment:
  kubernetes:
  portMappings:
    8081: 8081
  traefik:
    hosts:
        ...
          - host:
          all: "Host(`some.other.host.com`)"
          servicePort: 4091
          priority: 1000
```

resulted in `8081` being used as servicePort in the treafik rule instead of `4091`.

#### Release notes

The release notes (as you are reading them now) are generated from the `releases/notes` directory in the project
repository.
Whenever a release has changes that require your attention like: new cli commands, new features, breaking changes,
upgrade
instructions, etc. they will be included here.

### Create startup probes by default

When a project is using livenesProbes, but has no startupProbe defined, we resort to creating a startup probe from the
default values defined in the `mpyl_config.yml` file. This is done to prevent the project from being marked as
unhealthy.

### Fix namespace interpolation in the Traefik default hosts

The default hosts for Traefik are now interpolated with the namespace of the project in test/acceptance/production.
