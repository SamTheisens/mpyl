#### Run results
- Account for parallel runs when reading and writing the run results
- Test results are now also added to the output artifact instead of just to a file 
- The root `.mpyl` folder is now also cleaned up as part of `mpyl build clean`
- The run plan file is now written to `.mpyl/run_plan.pickle` and `.mpyl/run_plan.json` (replaces the old confusing `build_plan` name)
- Do not fail the build when trying to create a Kubernetes namespace that already exists
