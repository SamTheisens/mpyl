#### Argocd
Add support for an argocd repository and workflow within the caching push logic. 
A pull request will be created in the configured argocd repository with the created k8s manifest files. 
The folder structure has the following pattern: `k8s-manifests/{project.name.lower()}/{target}/{namespace}/manifest.yaml`.
