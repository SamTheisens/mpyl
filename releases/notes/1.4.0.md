#### Customizable stages

Stages are now customizable. You can add the stages to the run_properties according to the defined schema, for example:

```yaml
stages:
  - name: 'build'
    icon: '🏗️'
  - name: 'test'
    icon: '📋'
```

#### Support single stage runs

It is now possible to run a single stage. For example, to run only the `build` stage:

```bash
mpyl build run --stage build
```

If you want the results / report of the previous stage run to be combined with your current stage run, use the
`--sequential` flag. Without this flag, the previous results will be overwritten. The results are stored in a local
file in `.mpyl` using `pickle`, see `mpyl-reporter.py` for an example on how to use them.

#### Support for project overlaying

The MPyL recognizes the `project-override-*.yml` files and merges them to the parent yml(`project.yml`) file in the same
directory.
Using this functionality, you can define different deployments for the same project.
For example, you can deploy the same project with different settings to different environments or public domains.
