#### Customizable stages

Stages are now customizable. You can add the stages to the run_properties according to the defined schema, for example:
```yaml
stages:
  - name: 'build'
    icon: '🏗️'
  - name: 'test'
    icon: '📋'
```


#### Support single stage runs

It is now possible to run a single stage. For example, to run only the `build` stage:
```bash
mpyl build run --stage build
```
If you want the results / report of the previous stage run to be combined with your current stage run, use the 
`--sequential` flag. Without this flag, the previous results will be overwritten. The results are stored in a local
file in `.mpyl` using `pickle`, see `mpyl-reporter.py` for an example on how to use them.
